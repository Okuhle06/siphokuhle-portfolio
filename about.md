My name is **Siphokuhle Nkala**, and I have a **Bachelor's Diploma in Purchasing and Supply Management**. With time, my passion for technology grew stronger, which motivated me to change fields and study **Computer Science**, where I am currently in my **final semester**.

I am deeply interested in:
- Software engineering  
- Cybersecurity  
- Databases  
- Web technologies  
- Continuous learning and professional growth  

When I’m not studying or learning something new in tech, I enjoy **art and cooking**, which bring creativity and balance into my life.

My long-term goal is to build a strong career in **software engineering**, while continuing to expand my knowledge in **cybersecurity** and modern computing.
