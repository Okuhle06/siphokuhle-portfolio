Welcome to my personal portfolio website.

I have a background in **Purchasing and Supply Management**, and later transitioned into **Computer Engineering** because of my passion for technology. I enjoy working with modern tools, learning new technologies, and building my foundation towards becoming a **professional software engineer**.

In my spare time, I enjoy **art and cooking**, exploring new creative ideas both in the kitchen and on canvas.

This website showcases my projects, skills, and personal journey in tech.
